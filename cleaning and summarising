I used this query to check for duplicates in the film table:

SELECT 	  	Film_id,
		title,
		description,
       		release_year,
       		language_id,
       		rental_duration,
		rental_rate,
		length,
		replacement_cost,
		rating,
		last_update,
		special_features,
		fulltext,
       		COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY 	Film_id,
		title,
		description,
       		release_year,
       		language_id,
       		rental_duration,
		rental_rate,
		length,
		replacement_cost,
		rating,
		last_update,
		special_features,
		fulltext
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

All counts were 1 so there was no duplicate data in this precise table. 

Then I checked for missing and inconsistent data as follows: 

SELECT *
FROM film

The result was: 1000

Then

SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM film

The result was: 1000

So all records were distinct. 

I checked the first and last 10 rows for inconsistencies and didn'd find any. 
If I had found inconsistencies, I would have:

  	1) tried to find the source and get that information
	2) if no success with that, leave the column out  
	3) if I donâ€™t want to leave the column out, impute values with estimates 


To summarise the data in the film table I used:

SELECT
		MIN (rental_rate),
		MAX (rental_rate),
		AVG (rental_rate),
		COUNT (rental_rate)
FROM film;

and

SELECT mode() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating)
FROM film;
