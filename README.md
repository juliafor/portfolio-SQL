# Rockbuster top customer marketing campaign
For this course project I extracted and analysed data from a 16-table SQL data base of Rockbuster Stealth LLC.

Rockbuster is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

The data set contains film inventory, customers, and payments, amongst other things. 
The aim was to find the best spending customers in order to reward them as part of a marketing campaign.  

In the folders you can read my queries for: filtering, summarizing, joining tables and creating CTEs to obtain data, analyse it and answer business questions, such as: 

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
