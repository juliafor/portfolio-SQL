This is a query I used for filtering 

SELECT	rating,	
		COUNT (film_id) AS count_of_movies,
		AVG (rental_rate) AS avg_movie_rental_rate,
		MIN (rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,
		MAX (rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration
FROM film		
GROUP BY rating		
HAVING rating IN ('G', 
                  'PG');
