Here's a query with a subquery I wrote to find the average total amount paid by customers in specific cities

SELECT	AVG (total_amount_paid.total_amount_paid)
FROM	(SELECT 		
			A. customer_id AS customer_number,
			B. first_name,
			B. last_name,
			D. city,
			E. country,
			SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM 		payment A
    INNER JOIN 		customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    INNER JOIN 		address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    INNER JOIN 		city D ON C. city_id = D. city_id
    INNER JOIN 		country E on D. country_id = E. country_id
    WHERE 		city IN (
				'Aurora',
				'Pingxiang',
				'Baiyin',
				'Vitria de Santo Anto',
				'Surakarta', 
				'Torren',
				'Huaian',
				'Balurghat',
				'Rae Bareli',
				'Rockford')
    GROUP BY 		customer_number, first_name, last_name, city, country
    ORDER BY		SUM (amount) DESC 
    LIMIT		5) AS total_amount_paid


Here I left join a subquery

SELECT			D. country,
			COUNT (DISTINCT customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
			COUNT (DISTINCT top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM			customer A
INNER JOIN 		address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id 
INNER JOIN		city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN 		country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN 		(SELECT 		
				        A. customer_id AS customer_number,
				        B. first_name,
				        B. last_name,
				        D. city,
				        E. country,
				        SUM (amount) AS total_amount_paid
		FROM 			payment A
        	INNER JOIN 		customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
              	INNER JOIN 		address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
		INNER JOIN 		city D ON C. city_id = D. city_id
             	INNER JOIN 		country E on D. country_id = E. country_id
		WHERE 			city IN (
					                    'Aurora',
					                    'Pingxiang',
					                    'Baiyin',
					                    'Vitria de Santo Anto',
					                    'Surakarta', 
					                    'Torren',
					                    'Huaian',
					                    'Balurghat',
					                    'Rae Bareli',
					                    'Rockford')
              	GROUP BY 		customer_number, first_name, last_name, city, country
              	ORDER BY		SUM (amount) DESC 
		LIMIT			5) AS top_5_customers
ON 		D.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY	D.country
